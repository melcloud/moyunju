## Introduction
 DNS directs web traffic to your Linode and email to your inbox by mapping memorable domain names like example.com to IP addresses like 192.0.2.8 or 0123:4567:89ab:cdef:0123:4567:89ab:cdef.

## Domains
Domain names are best understood by reading from right to left. The broadest domain classification is on the right, and becomes more specific as you move to the left. In the examples below, the top-level domain, or TLD, is .com.

although first-level subdomains plus their TLDs (example.com) are conventionally referred to as domains.

tl;dr; This is a pretty long post, so for convenience, here's some links to the relevant sections and a one-liner use case:

microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-runtime-deps - use for deploying self-contained deployment apps
microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-runtime - use for deploying .NET Core console apps
microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-aspnetcore-runtime - use for deploying ASP.NET Core apps
microsoft/dotnet:2.1.300-sdk - use for building .NET Core (or ASP.NET Core apps)

kill -HUP <processID> to send the SIGHUP signal
